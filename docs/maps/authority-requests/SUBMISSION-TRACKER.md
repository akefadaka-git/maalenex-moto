## Non-negotiable release controls

- A boundary polygon is not proof of a road, road access or motorcycle suitability.
- Historical 2020 codes are not current identifiers without an authoritative crosswalk.
- No candidate data may activate production map, routing, dispatch, ETA, fare calculation or offline distribution.
- Keep `MAP_PROVIDER_MODE = "schematic"` until separate data, safety, rights and Owner approval gates pass.
